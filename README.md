# Brainfuck Interpreter written in Rust

- **Program Description**: This Brainfuck interpreter displays the program's memory state and execution step by step.
- **Visual Memory Representation**: The grid shown in the image represents the memory of the Brainfuck program.
- **Execution Pointer**: The red cell highlights the memory location currently being executed by the interpreter.
- **Memory Clear**: Cells/Memory is reset evey time the program is run.
- **Memory Out Of Bounds auto fix**: When program tries to use more memory than allocated, more is allocated.
- **Values Out Of Bounds auto fix**: When trying to add more than 255 it goes bac to 0 and in reverse too.

## What is Brainfuck?

**Brainfuck** is a minimalistic esoteric programming language, notable for its extreme simplicity, small size, and almost cryptic syntax. It was created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller and is designed to challenge and amuse programmers rather than being a practical language for large-scale software development. The language consists of only eight commands, each represented by a single character:

- `>`: Move the pointer to the right
- `<`: Move the pointer to the left
- `+`: Increment the byte at the pointer
- `-`: Decrement the byte at the pointer
- `.`: Output the byte at the pointer as an ASCII character
- `,`: Accept one byte of input, storing its value at the pointer
- `[`: If the byte at the pointer is zero, jump forward past the matching `]`
- `]`: If the byte at the pointer is nonzero, jump backward to the matching `[`

Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is Turing-complete, meaning it can theoretically compute any computable function given enough time and memory. Its code often appears as a collection of `+`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `[`, `]`, `.`, and `,`, resulting in programs that look extremely terse and obfuscated. This makes Brainfuck a favorite tool for code golfers, obfuscators, and enthusiasts who enjoy pushing languages to their limits.
